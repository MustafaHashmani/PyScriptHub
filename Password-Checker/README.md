# Password-Checker

It takes a Password as input and returns whether the password was hacked/leaked in a data breach

It can take multiple arguments through the command line where each argument is the password to search

For example: `python .\main.py password123` would print whether the password was hacked. If it was hacked, it would return the number of times.
